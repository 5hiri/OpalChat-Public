# OpalChat
OpalChat is a desktop application designed to provide a unified interface for chatting with Artificial Intelligence. Its primary goal is to seamlessly integrate both remote Large Language Models (LLMs) via APIs (such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude) and local AI models running on the user's hardware.
